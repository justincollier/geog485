	<h2>Question 1</h2>
	<p>What is the high-level description of the problem/question you want to help answer through 
	the presentation of a collection of geographic data over the internet? Please answer in a 
	short paragraph.</p>
	<p class="answer">For this assignment I'd like to display all of the water sources present in Bernalillo County. 
	This will include surface water and groundwater. I also hope to display some more specific water sources, like wells.</p>
	
	
	<h2>Question 2</h2>
	<p>Who is the target audience for the information you want to provide?</p>
	<p class="answer">My target audience is pretty much everyone, but I'll focus on the general public.</p>
	
	
	<h2>Question 3</h2>
	<p>What geographic region does your problem area represent? Please describe it in words 
	(e.g. New Mexico, Alberta Canada, etc.) and define it in terms of a geographic (WGS84) 
	(latitude and longitude) bounding box.</p>
	<p class="answer">Bernalillo county, New Mexico, USA: -107.19635, 35.218697 (upper left corner) to -106.153078, 34.870158 (lower right corner).</p>
	
	
	<h2>Question 4</h2>
	<p>What types of data do you want to include in your project? Include a description 
	(data content: e.g. elevation data, hydrographic survey, etc.) and types (i.e. raster, vector).</p>
	<p class="answer">I'd like to include a raster basemap, vector county lines, vector surface water/groundwater data.</p>
	
	
	<h2>Question 5</h2>
	<p>What projection will you use for the presentation of your project data? Again, describe it, 
	provide your reasoning for selection, and provide the corresponding EPSG code.</p>
	<p class="answer">I'd like to use WGS 84 EPSG:4326 because it is common and I've worked with it already. 
	However, the data I've already found is only in NAD83 EPSG:4269, so I'll probably be using that.</p>
	
	
	<h2>Question 6</h2>
	<p>Where do you anticipate acquiring data for the project from?</p>
	<p class="answer">I will most likely be getting my data from RGIS since my area of focus is in New Mexico. 
	However, I'll obtain my basemap elsewhere, most likely from nationalmap.gov as I've used it before.</p>
	
	
	<h2>Question 7</h2>
	<p>What barriers to acquiring and processing the needed data do you anticipate?</p>
	<p class="answer">The main barrier I expect to face is finding my data. 
	I also expect to go through many hardships getting this data all working together.</p>
