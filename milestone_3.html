	<h2>Question 1</h2>
	<p>What area do you want to depict in your map? Why?</p>
	<p>Elephant Butte reservoir.
	I think this is an interesting area because the reservoir's
	water level has experienced some decline.</p>
	
	<h2>Question 2</h2>
	<p>What is the center point (latitude and longitude) of your area of interest?</p>
	<p>+33°11'35.58", -107°11'18.48".</p>
	
	<h2>Question 3</h2>
	<p>What style of map (roads, satellite, hybrid, terrain) is appropriate for your map? Why?</p>
	<p>Satellite.</p>
	
	<h2>Question 4</h2>
	<p>What is the scale of your map (local, regional, continental, global)? 
	How will this translate into your selection of an appropriate default zoom level for your map?</p>
	<p>local. This means that for my default zoom, I will have to be pretty far zoomed in.</p>
	
	<h2>Question 5</h2>
	<p>Embed a Google Map in your writeup that is based upon your responses to questions 1-4 above.</p>
