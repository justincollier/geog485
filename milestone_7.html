	<h2>Question 1</h2>
	<p>What is the aspect ratio of this geographic region?</p>
	<p>BBOX width = (maxx) - (minx) = (-106.5) - (-109.5) = 3 degrees<br>
	BBOX height = (maxy) - (miny) = (36.5) - (34.5) = 2 degrees<br>
	BBOX aspect ratio = (BBOX width) / (BBOX height) = (3) / (2) = 1.5</p>
	
	<h2>Question 2</h2>
	<p>What would be the height (in whole pixels) for a map image for this region that is
	600 pixels wide?</p>
	<p>BBOX height = (BBOX width) / (BBOX aspect ratio) = (600px) / (1.5) = 400px</p>
	
	<h2>Question 3</h2>
	<p>Formulate a WMS request that reflects the values determined in 1.1 and 1.2 above
	for the WMS service used above in the examples. Include in your answer both the actual
	WMS request and the returned map image.</p>

	<h2>Question 4</h2>
	<p>Formulate a WMS request for a 900x600 pixel map image that represents the full
	3-degree width of the geographic region, and is based upon the minimum Y value of
	34.5 degrees North Latitude. Include in your answer both the WMS request and the
	returned map image.</p>
	<p>http://gstore.unm.edu/apps/rgis/datasets/97810/services/ogc/wms?VERSION=1.1.1&SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetMap&BBOX=-109.5,34.5,-106.5,36.5&LAYERS=2007fe_35_county00&FORMAT=image/png&TRANSPARENT=TRUE&STYLES=&SRS=EPSG:4326&WIDTH=900&HEIGHT=600</p>

	<h2>Question 5</h2>
	<p>Given a WMS that is represented by the following GetCapabilities request,
	formulate individual GetMap requests using the following parameters:<br>

	BBOX=-106.639,35.074,-106.609,35.094 WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=400<br>

	for each of the following layers: 0 (TNM_Large_Scale_Imagery) and 1 (1_foot_imagery)
	- yes - USGS just gave numbers as the layer names</p>
	<p></p>
	
	<h2>Question 6</h2>
	<p>Which layers return map images that display image content (i.e. return a non-blank
	image)?<br>
	Sometimes when WMS layers are accessed, there is a limit on the map scales for which
	the map image will be returned. If a request is submitted for a map scale that is
	outside the range specified for a given layer, typically, a blank map image will be
	returned.</p>
	<p></p>

	<h2>Question 7</h2>
	<p>From examining the information for these layers in the GetCapabilities XML
	document - which element in each layerâ€™s service metadata do you think provides
	information about the scales for which the layer will return map images containing
	data?<br>
	You can effectively change the scale of a map image by changing the pixel dimensions
	of the requested image.</p>
	<p></p>
	
	<h2>Question 8</h2>
	<p>Which map images contain data for each of the following map image widths
	(remember to adjust the image height to match the BBOX of the request)<br>
	30 pixels<br>
	1200 pixels</p>
