	<h2>Question 1</h2>
	<p>What search engine did you use?</p>
	<p>Bing</p>
	
	<h2>Question 2</h2>
	<p>How many ‘hits’ did you get?</p>
	<p>192,000,000</p>
	
	<h2>Question 3</h2>
	<p>How useful (generally in terms of getting a pointers to live WMS services
	[defined as a functioning GetCapabilities request]) were the ‘hits’?</p>
	<p>Many of the top hits were pages explaining what the services are, such as wikipedia
	pages. It only took a second to find actual live WMS services though.</p>
	
	<h2>Question 4</h2>
	<h3>Service #1</h3>
	<li>What is the URL for the full GetCapabilities request to the service?</li>
	<p>http://nsidc.org/cgi-bin/atlas_north?service=WMS&request=GetCapabilities&version=1.1.1</p>
	<li>What is the Name of the service?</li>
	<p>OGC:WMS</p>
	<li>What Format(s) are available for GetMap requests from the service?</li>
	<p>tiff, gif, png; mode=24bit, jpeg, vnd.wap.wbmp, & svg+xml</p>
	<li>How many layers are included in the service (including nesting layers)?</li>
	<p>95</p>
	
	<h3>Service #2</h3>
	<li>What is the URL for the full GetCapabilities request to the service?</li>
	<p>http://wms.jpl.nasa.gov/wms.cgi?Service=WMS&amp;Version=1.1.1&amp;Request=GetCapabilities</p>
	<li>What is the Name of the service?</li>
	<p>OGC:WMS</p>
	<li>What Format(s) are available for GetMap requests from the service?</li>
	<p>jpeg, png, geotiff, tiff, vnd.google-earth.kml+xml</p>
	<li>How many layers are included in the service (including nesting layers)?</li>
	<p>17</p>
	
	<h2>Question 5</h2>
	<h3>For one of the layers in the first service:</h3>
	<li>What is the name of the layer?</li>
	<p>cryosphere_atlas_north</p>
	<li>What is the SRS of the layer?</li>
	<p><a href="http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/3408/">EPSG:3408</a></p>
	<li>What is the name of the projection that matches the SRS EPSG code?</li>
	<p>NSIDC EASE-Grid North</p>
	<li>What is the LatLonBoundingBox of the layer?</li>
	<p>minx="-178.854" miny="-76.4039" maxx="180" maxy="90"</p>
	
	<h2>Question 6</h2>
	<p>Open the following GetCapabilities request in your browser. Select “View Source”
	from the browser menu to see the delivered XML document (it may appear as an unformatted
	string of text by default in your browser - if that is the case, save the file to your
	hard drive and view it in a text editor). Use the information in the XML capabilities
	document to formulate GetMap requests for the following map images. Include the requests
	and resulting images in your write-up. Comment on anything unusual that you notice in
	the images that are returned.</p>
	
	<li>for the area surrounding Bernalillo County (-107.2,34.7,-106,35.25) as a 200x200 pixel JPEG</li>
	<li>for the same area as a 500x500 pixel PNG</li>
	<p>http://gstore.unm.edu/apps/rgis/datasets/92403ebf-aec5-404b-ae8a-6db41f388737/services/ogc/wms?request=GetMap&srs=EPSG:4326&format=image/jpeg&width=200&height=200&bbox=-107.2,34.7,-106,35.25&layers=2007fe_35_county</p>
		<p><a href="images/wms200.jpeg">200 x 200</a></p>
	<p>http://gstore.unm.edu/apps/rgis/datasets/92403ebf-aec5-404b-ae8a-6db41f388737/services/ogc/wms?request=GetMap&srs=EPSG:4326&format=image/png&width=500&height=500&bbox=-107.2,34.7,-106,35.25&layers=2007fe_35_county</p>
		<p><a href="images/wms500.png">500 x 500</a></p>
	<p>Both of these images are compressed horizontally (or stretched vertically, depending
	on your view of the world), making Bernalillo County look like a fatty.</p>

	<h2>Question 7</h2>
	<p>Open the following (linked) KML file in Google Earth, uncompress it, and save the
	contained KML file on your computer. Open the KML file in a text editor
	(e.g. Text Wrangler [Mac], Notepad/Notepad++ [Windows]).</p>
	<p>Add a second Placemark element to the KML file that represents a square region
	that is completely contained within the state boundary. Save the KML file and open
	it in Google Earth (download from http://www.google.com/earth/index.html) or view it
	in Google Maps (by adding it to your GitHub gh-pages branch) as demonstrated in the
	lecture to verify that you have successfully created the file. Submit the KML file
	(as a link in your writeup) as part of your writeup for the milestone.</p>
