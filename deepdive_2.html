	<p class="answer"></p>

	
	
	<h2>Question 5</h2>
	<p>Which OGC request would you submit under the following circumstances 
	(include both the service type [e.g. WMS, WFS, WCS], and the request 
	[e.g. GetMap, GetCapabilities, GetCoverage, etc.] in your answer)</p>

	JPEG for a specified area of interest.</li>
	<p class="answer"></p>
	<li>You want to retrieve data representing geometries and associated attributes 
	for a road network, with the returned data in GML.</li>
	<p class="answer"></p>

	(a raster dataset) in the form of a GeoTIFF.</li>
	<p class="answer"></p>
	
	
	<h2>Question 6</h2>
	<p>What are the EPSG codes of the following Spatial Reference Systems</p>
	<li>WGS 84 (Geodetic CRS [geographic 2d])</li>
	<p class="answer">EPSG:4326</p>
