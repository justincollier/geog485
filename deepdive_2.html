	<h2>Question 1</h2>
	<p>What request type is common across all three (WMS, WFS, WCS) 
	OGC web services that we have learned about?</p>
	<p class="answer">GetCapabilities</p>
	
	
	<h2>Question 2</h2>
	<p>Answer the following questions about a WMS GetCapabilities request</p>
	<li>What are the required parameters, and what do they represent?</li>
	<p class="answer">
	VERSION <br>
	This is the version of the request <br><br>
	SERVICE <br>
	This is the type of service <br><br>
	REQUEST <br>
	This is the name of the request <br><br>
	</p>
	<li>What is returned in response to a WMS GetCapabilities request?</li>
	<p class="answer">An xml file with metadata about what can be requested from the service</p>

	
	
	<h2>Question 3</h2>
	<p>Answer the following questions about a WMS GetMap request</p>
	<li>What are the required parameters, and what do they represent?</li>
	<p class="answer">
	VERSION <br>
	This is the version of the request <br><br>
	REQUEST <br>
	This is the name of the request <br><br>
	LAYERS <br>
	This is the map layer(s) that you want to retrieve, essentially the information 
	you want your map to display <br><br>
	STYLES<br>
	This is the style of the map <br><br>
	SRS<br>
	This is the spatial reference system used for the map you are requesting <br><br>
	BBOX<br>
	This is the minimum and maximum coordinates of the map to be displayed, in the SRS units <br><br>
	WIDTH<br>
	This is the width of the map in pixels <br><br>
	HEIGHT<br>
	This is the height of the map in pixels <br><br>
	FORMAT<br>
	This is the image format in which the map you are requesting is output 
	</p>
	<li>What is returned in response to a WMS GetMap request?</li>
	<p class="answer">An image of a map</p>
	<li>What is the significance of transparency in WMS requests?</li>
	<p class="answer">Transparency allows the background of a map to be transparent 
	instead of white or some other color, however only gifs support transparency.</p>
	
	
	<h2>Question 4</h2>
	<p>What OGC request would you use to inform the configuration of a 
	client application (like ArcGIS) about an OGC service that you want to add layers from?</p>
	<p class="answer">Web Map Service</p>

	
	
	<h2>Question 5</h2>
	<p>Which OGC request would you submit under the following circumstances 
	(include both the service type [e.g. WMS, WFS, WCS], and the request 
	[e.g. GetMap, GetCapabilities, GetCoverage, etc.] in your answer)</p>
	<li>You want a map image representing three layers of data in a single 
	JPEG for a specified area of interest.</li>
	<p class="answer">WMS GetMap</p>
	<li>You want to retrieve data representing geometries and associated attributes 
	for a road network, with the returned data in GML.</li>
	<p class="answer">WFS GetFeature</p>
	<li>You want to retrieve data representing a digital elevation model 
	(a raster dataset) in the form of a GeoTIFF.</li>
	<p class="answer">WCS GetCoverage</p>

	<li>WGS 84 (Geodetic CRS [geographic 2d])</li>
	<p class="answer">EPSG:4326</p>
	<li>NAD83 / UTM zone 13N</li>
	<p class="answer">EPSG:26913</p>
	<li>NAD27 / UTM zone 13N</li>
	<p class="answer">EPSG:26713</p>
	
	
	<h2>Question 7</h2>
